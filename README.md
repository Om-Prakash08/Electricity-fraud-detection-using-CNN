Electricity theft is harmful to power grid suppliers and causes economic losses. Integrating information flows with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data analysis on the data of smart grids helps detect electricity theft because of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. Therefore, we aim to design a novel electricity theft detection method using a Wide & Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to learn the electricity consumption data and identify the electricity thieves.
